# COVID-19-Face-Mask-Detector
A model to determine whether or not an individual is wearing a COVID-19 face mask with features including multi-person detection and audio alerts to enhance precision and practicality.

After detection, a message will be displayed according to the situation, that is, either ‘Mask’ or ‘No Mask’ along with appropriate audio. This detector works even when more than one person is present within the frame, and further shows the precision of the mask worn in percentage.

Imported files used and their purpose:
1. tensorflow – to visualize the data with a graphical approach
2. keras – to develop deep model
3. imutils – for image processing
4. numpy – to perform mathematical operations on arrays
5. opencv – for machine learning and image processing
6. matplotlib – application programming interface using GUI
7. scipy – to visualize data and solve mathematical and scientific operations
